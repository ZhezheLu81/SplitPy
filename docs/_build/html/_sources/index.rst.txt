SplitPy Project documentation
=============================

SplitPy is a teleseismic shear-wave (SKS) Splitting Toolbox based on the 
Matlab Tool SplitLab, but with modifications from Wustefeld et al (2008). 
Additional error surface implementation has been added, however these error 
surfaces have not been fully tested.
