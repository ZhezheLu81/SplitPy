SplitPy is a software for estimating teleseismic shear-wave splitting parameters
based on the Matlab Tool SplitLab, but with modifications from 
`Wustefeld et al (2008) <https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2007.08.002>`_.
Additional error surface implementation has been added, however these error 
surfaces have not been fully tested.

Installation
------------

Dependencies
++++++++++++

The current version was developed using **Python3.7** \
Also, the following packages are required:

- `stdb <https://github.com/paudetseis/StDb>`_
- `dill <https://pypi.org/project/dill/>`_

Other required packages (e.g., ``obspy``, ``PyQt5``)
will be automatically installed by ``stdb``.

Conda environment
+++++++++++++++++

We recommend creating a custom ``conda`` environment
where ``SplitPy`` can be installed along with some of its dependencies.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda create -n split python=3.7 obspy dill -c conda-forge

Activate the newly created environment:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda activate split

Install remaining dependencies using ``pip`` inside the ``split`` environment:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install stdb

Installing from Pypi
++++++++++++++++++++

*This option is not available yet - install from source only*

Installing from source
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Clone the repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/SplitPy.git
   cd SplitPy

- Install using pip:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install .
